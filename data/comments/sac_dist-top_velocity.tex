Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_dist-top_velocity} shows the distribution of the top absolute velocity. 
Note that this information is a bit imprecise, because it is computed by a simple derivative filter which is affected by measurement noise. 

However, while the absolute velocity is not precise, the relative velocity among different species should be considered reliable. For example, \Dmelanogaster is the fastest, and  \Dhydei is the slowest.
