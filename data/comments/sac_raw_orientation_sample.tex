These plots show the orientation histogram for each recorded log. We see that some of the peaks in Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_raw_orientation} depend only on one particular log.
For example, the two peaks in Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_raw_orientation:Darizonae} depend only on log, as can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_raw_orientation_sample:Darizonae}.
