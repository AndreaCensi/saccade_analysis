Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_turn_count} shows the number of left and right turn as a function of the head direction. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_turn_count:Dmelanogaster} shows an interesting pattern. It seems that the flies are attracted to an orientation of around 90deg. If they are on the left of that point, they tend to saccade right, and vice versa. This would explain the inhomogeneity in Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_raw_orientation:Dmelanogaster}.
