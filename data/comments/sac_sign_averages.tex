Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_sign_averages} shows the ratio of left turns for each log in the data. Note that we have a different number of logs for each species. Moreover, the length of such logs varies considerably. 

If left and right turns were equiprobable, we would expect the bars to be inside the 99\% bounds indicated by the red brackets. Because most of the bars are not inside the bounds, we have to conclude that there is some bias in the sample. Perhaps each fly has a favorite direction?
