These plots show the distribution of the saccade amplitude. This quantity is  easy to compute inequivocably from the data, so this is supposed to be very reliable information.

Note that the minimum saccade amplitude we detect is \textbf{5deg}. Below that value, given the uncertainty of the measurements, it is really hard to distinguish what is a saccade and what a simple oscillation.
