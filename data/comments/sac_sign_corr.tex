Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_sign_corr} shows the autocorrelation of the saccade direction. Each log is shown as a seperate line. Note that some logs are clearly outliers. See for example Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_sign_corr:Dmelanogaster} (\Dmelanogaster): there is one log which whose autocorrelation is qualitatively different than the others. That corresponds to a fly which started spinning in one direction, and continued to do so. 

Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_sign_corr2} shows the average of the curves in Fig.~\ref{fig:sac_sign_corr}.
