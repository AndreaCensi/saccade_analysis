function fullname = ffpath(fname)
%   FFPATH    Find file path
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% The function browses very fast current directory and directories known in 
% 'matlabpath' and the system variable 'path'. It searches for the file,
% name of which is in the input argument 'fname'. If a directory is found, 
% the output argument pth is filled by path to the file name from the input
% argument, otherwise pth is empty.
% File names should have their extensions, but MATLAB m-files.
% 
% Arguments:
%   fname   file name 
%   pth     path to the fname
%
% Examples:
%   pth = ffpath('gswin32c.exe')
%   pth =
%   c:\Program Files\gs\gs8.60\bin\
%
%   pth = ffpath('hgrc')
%   pth =
%   C:\PROGRA~1\MATLAB\R2006b\toolbox\local
