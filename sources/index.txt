Saccade analysis tools
======================

This repository contains various tools for analyzing saccade patterns of flies from tethered and free flight data.

There are several distinct chunks of code aggregated here:

* Matlab code for extracting saccades from tethered data, hand-labeling the samples for QA insurange, and generation of accuracy statistics.

* Matlab code for analyzing saccade patterns (both tethered and free flight).

* Python code for doing some additional analysis.


A companion package, in a separate repository, is the
`Geometric Saccade Detector`_,
a Python tool to extract saccades from Flydra_ data.
